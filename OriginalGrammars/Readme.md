# Original TeX/LaTeX/ConTeXt related textmate grammars

Our ConTeXt grammar is based upon the
[`context.tmLanguage`](https://github.com/JulianGmp/vscode-context-syntax/blob/master/syntaxes/context.tmLanguage)
grammar file.

The supporting TeX and LaTeXt grammars are based upon the
[TeX.plist](https://github.com/textmate/latex.tmbundle/blob/master/Syntaxes/TeX.plist)
and
[LaTeX.plist](https://github.com/textmate/latex.tmbundle/blob/master/Syntaxes/LaTeX.plist)
grammar files.

## Conversion from plist format

All grammars have been converted to JSON format using the `plist2json`
Python script in this directory.

## Licenses

In all cases the original grammar file has an associated `-license` file
which documents where and when our copy has been taken as well as the
original License.

All files have been used under "permissive" Open Source licenses.

# LPiC Syntaxes

This project provides the definitive source for all TextMate syntaxes used in
the Literate Programming in ConTeXt projects.

Since it is used in both the Python based language servers (conTeXt-langServer,
lpic-langServer) as well as in the corresponding VSCode extensions
(vscode-context, vscode-lpic), this project has both a Python package
description (pyproject.toml) as well as a NPM package description
(package.json).

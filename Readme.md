# LPiC Syntaxes

This project provides the definitive source for all TextMate syntaxes used in
the Literate Programming in ConTeXt projects.

Since it is used in both the Python based language servers (conTeXt-langServer,
lpic-langServer) as well as in the corresponding VSCode extensions
(vscode-context, vscode-lpic), this project has both a Python package
description (pyproject.toml) as well as a NPM package description
(package.json).

The definitive source for all of the grammars we *maintain* can be found in the
`RubyGrammars` directory.  See the `Readme.md` file in the `RubyGrammars`
directory for details.

The original versions of all grammars we *use* (unchanged), along with their
associated licenses and providence, can be found in the `OriginalGrammars`
directory. See the `Readme.md` in the `OriginalGrammars` directory for more
details.
